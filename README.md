## LRL-Baselines

A collection of lifelong/continual learning baselines for reinforcement learning.

This repository is a growing collection of lifelong/continual learning baselines for reinforcement learning. If you’ve ever tried to track down and run baselines from the literature for a paper, you know how tedious and frustrating it can be. The goal here is to make that process faster and less error-prone by providing library of implementations of published baselines built on the Modulating Masks/DeepRL codebase and modified if needed to specifically experiment on reinforcement learning benchmarks. This way you can run find relevant algorithms in a familiar environment and compare results quicker and more easily.

Inspired by the Avalanche continual learning repository for supervised learning. https://github.com/ContinualAI/continual-learning-baselines and CORA https://github.com/AGI-Labs/continual_rl

If you implement additional algorithms from the literature in the Modulating Masks/DeepRL codebase, please contribute them to this repository as a new branch. This project only works if we maintain it together. Don't forget to also update the table below:
